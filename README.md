- 👋 Hi, I’m @ceciogit

- 💞️ 
I am actually "porting" a Cms/Cck (content construction kit) that i have created and used for years for multiple purposes ex. simple cms for website up to micro-ERP for small business companies.
the software is currently written in php 7.4 and is based on the Joomla! Framework.
it contains the logic for the creation of Models Views and Controllers php files directly from the backend through a "drag and drop" interface that generates a json which in turn is used for the creation of the MySql tables and the UI.
I am quite proud of my software and it still allows me to save a lot of time if the customer asks to add a couple of fields, or relationships, even if the fields are galleries, file uploaders , etc.

However I am trying to migrate everything to Laravel + Sanctum + Vue + Axios + TailwindCss and going in SPA
and I was thinking of sharing the project with someone who is interested in making something similar, or participating in some ongoing project that does what I have described. (maybe i will record a short video to illustrate that better).
if the project is NOT opensource for me it is even better, in the sense that usually ERP CRM etc are products intended for companies and rarely distributed for free.

i usually work in the dark and totally alone "like a worm"  but ive thinked that will be nice to have and give some help... that's all.
I realize it's a shot in the dark, but you never know ...

let me know if someone is interested in it or is already working on a similiar project.
